                Hey there! I’m Mulla Affan, a full-stack web developer with a strong focus on building clean, responsive, and scalable web applications.

                I work with <span className="text-orange-500 font-semibold">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React</span> on the frontend to create smooth and user-friendly interfaces. On the backend, I use <span className="text-orange-500 font-semibold">Node.js, Express, and MongoDB</span> to power dynamic and secure applications.

                I enjoy turning ideas into real products and solving real-world problems with code. Whether it's creating a landing page, developing APIs, or building full web platforms, I love being part of the entire development process.

                I’m always up for learning new things, working on exciting projects, and collaborating with like-minded people who are just as passionate about tech as I am.

            </p>
